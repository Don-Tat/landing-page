# landing-page

Welcome to my submission for the Landing Page Project as part of The Odin Project course. This project demonstrates my proficiency in using HTML and CSS to create a captivating and responsive landing page. The goal of this project was to apply the knowledge and skills I have acquired throughout the course to build a visually appealing and functional landing page for a fictional product or service.
